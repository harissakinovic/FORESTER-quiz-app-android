# forester

Forester is quis about trees. It is about to learn latin and bosnien names of trees and also to be able to recognise these trees with pictures.   
It is created with 3 levels easy, medium and hard and each of them have 5 different levels.
Easy has trees that are very known in Bosnia and Herzegovina and you have just to choose right name ( Bosnien <-> Latin)
Medium nivo has trees that are not so much known and here starts questions with images. You get image and you have to pick right name (again Bosnien <-> Latin).
Hard nivo has trees that just real tree lovers know and questions are more compicated. In hard nivo you can not choose answer, but you have to write it.

I used Android studio, JAVA and SQLite database to create this quiz.
